==================
This assignment is entitled "Your Portfolio," and it is meant to include three pages â€“ a homepage, a page containing a biography, and a page containing a resume.

All of the html and css files for this assignment pass the w3 standards, and they were therefore correctly implemented.

No collaboration was made when working on this assignment.

Roughly five or six hours were spent on completing this assignment, from first looking at it to finishing the management of github. Because this is my first time using git, a large amount of time was spent finding a version that would work on my computer and getting my bearings with git.
